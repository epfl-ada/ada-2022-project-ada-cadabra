# What defines your relationship with a beer ?
ADA-cadabra group

Abstract:
The aim of this project is to uncover what defines one's relationship to a beer. To that end, we'll explore the different aspects of the data that could affect one's rating/review of a beer. Is it the stimulation of our 5 senses through the different sensory cues a beer provides (visual, olfactory, gustatory ...) that make us judge a beer the way we do? Is it rather related to our entourage and we tend to drink local beers from our area by habit/culture? Or rather are there globally good beers that everyone everywhere like? Perhaps is it the popularity of a certain brewery that makes people consume their beers?
